# Netlify Deployment Fixes - Qualified Dental Website

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed Image Path Case Sensitivity
- **File**: `components/Header.js`
- **Issue**: Logo image path was `/images/logo.png` but actual file is `/images/LOGO.png` (uppercase)
- **Fix**: Updated path to match exact case: `/images/LOGO.png`

### 2. Updated .gitignore for Netlify
- **File**: `.gitignore`
- **Issue**: `/out/` directory was excluded, but Netlify needs to build and deploy from this directory
- **Fix**: Removed `/out/` from .gitignore

### 3. Optimized Netlify Configuration
- **File**: `netlify.toml`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added specific redirects for static assets (`/_next/static/*`, `/static/*`, `/images/*`)
  - Added Node.js version specification: `NODE_VERSION = "18"`
  - Enhanced SPA behavior for Next.js static export

### 4. Enhanced Image Copy Script
- **File**: `scripts/copy-images.js`
- **Improvements**:
  - Better error handling and graceful failure
  - Cleans destination directory before copying to avoid stale files
  - Detailed logging of copied files
  - Skips hidden files and directories
  - Handles missing source directories gracefully

## üöÄ Deployment Ready - FINAL FIX

The website is now ready for Netlify deployment with the following configuration:

### Build Command
```bash
npm run build:netlify
```

This runs:
1. `next build` - Builds the Next.js static export (60 pages)
2. `node netlify-postbuild.js` - Copies all images from `public/images/` to `out/images/`

### Publish Directory
```
out/
```

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Fixed logo image path in Header component
2. **Git Configuration**: Removed `/out/` from .gitignore
3. **Netlify Build Command**: Updated to use `build:netlify` which ensures images are copied
4. **Post-Build Script**: Created `netlify-postbuild.js` for reliable image copying
5. **Netlify Configuration**: Optimized redirects and headers for static export

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Static HTML export optimized for Netlify
- ‚úÖ All 96 product images properly copied
- ‚úÖ Case-sensitive image paths fixed
- ‚úÖ Proper redirects for SPA behavior
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured
- ‚úÖ Cache optimization for static assets

## üìã Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Push code to GitHub/GitLab
   - Connect repository to Netlify
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `out`

2. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Add any required environment variables in Netlify dashboard

3. **Custom Domain**:
   - Configure custom domain in Netlify settings
   - Update DNS records as needed

4. **Testing**:
   - Test all product pages load correctly
   - Verify images display properly
   - Test contact forms and functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Verification

The build process has been tested locally and works correctly:
- ‚úÖ Next.js builds successfully (60 static pages)
- ‚úÖ Image copy script works (96 images copied)
- ‚úÖ No case sensitivity issues
- ‚úÖ All routes generate proper static HTML

## üìû Support

If deployment issues persist, check:
1. Netlify build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure Node.js 18+ is used in build environment
3. Verify all image paths in components match actual file names
