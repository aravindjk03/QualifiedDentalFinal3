# Image Loading Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Problem
Images work locally but not on Netlify deployment because Next.js static export doesn't automatically copy the `public/images` folder to the `out` directory.

## Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Configuration Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update `next.config.js` with proper static export settings
- [x] Create build script to copy images from public to out directory
- [x] Update `package.json` with post-build script

### Phase 2: Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test build process locally: `npm run build` - ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Verify `out` directory contains images folder - ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Test local production build: `npx serve out` - ✅ SUCCESS (images loading with 200 status)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify and verify images load

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Check browser console for 404 errors
- [ ] Test image loading on all pages
- [ ] Verify SEO meta tags with images work correctly
